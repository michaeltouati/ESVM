# Compiling the code

Modify the makefile as a function of the wished compilation options and the Fortran compiler installed on your computer and then type :

```sh
make
```
It is recommended to compile the code with the double-precision option (-fdefault-real-8 for the GNU compiler gfortran or -r8 for the INTEL compiler ifort). 

The compilation can be tested by typing
```sh
make test
```
The tests consist in comparing file1 and file2 where :
* file1 is one test simulation terminal output performed with an input deck located in the directory 'test-cases/Tests/' and
* file2 is the terminal output of the corresponding simulation already performed by the developper also located in 'test-cases/Tests/'.

# Running a simulation

Fill the wished input-deck (all parameters are described inside), eventually check them by typing
```sh
./check-input-deck
```
or
```sh
make check
```
and then type :
```sh
./esvm
```
or
```sh
make run
```
to run the simulation.

# Plotting the simulation results

All simulation results are stored in files located in the directory 'results'. 
Python scripts allowing to extract and plot the simulation results are located in the directory 'sources/plot'.
They can be used by simply typing :
```sh
make plot
```
to plot all the results, even when the simulation is still running. The resulting plots will be stored in the directory 'figures'. It can also be plotted separately :
- the energies scalar plots by typing :
```sh
make plot_energies
```
or
```sh
python3 sources/plot/plot_logfe.py
```
- the 1D plasma electron hydrodynamic moments space-time density maps by typing :
```sh
make plot_hydro2D
```
or
```sh
python3 sources/plot/plot_hydro2D.py
```
- the 1D plasma electron hydrodynamic moments scalar plots by typing : 
```sh
make plot_hydro1D
```
or
```sh
python3 sources/plot/plot_hydro1D.py
```
- or the 1D1V plasma electron distribution function phase-space density maps by typing :
```sh
make plot_fe
```
or
```sh
python3 sources/plot/plot_fe.py
```
If you need to plot the 1D1V plasma electron distribution function phase-space density maps in logarithmic scale instead, type :
```sh
make plot_logfe
```
or
```sh
python3 sources/plot/plot_logfe.py
```

# Cleaning the directory

If you want to remove from the ESVM directory :
- the compilation files and ESVM executables, type :
```sh
make distclean
```
- the directory 'figures' containing all simulations results plots, type :
```sh
make figclean
```
- the directory 'results' containing all simulations results data files, type :
```sh
make resclean
```
- the three previous ones, type :
```sh
make clean
```
Be careful, the three latters will remove all simulations results/figures. Store them elsewhere if you don't want to lose them.
