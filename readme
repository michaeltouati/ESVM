ESVM (ElectroStatic Vlasov-Maxwell) is a 1D-1V Vlasov-Maxwell code developed for an educational purpose and for testing different numerical advection schemes.

In order to :

1) Compile the code :

Modify the makefile as a function of the wished compilation options and the compilers installed on your computer and then type :

make

2) Run a simulation :

Fill the wished input-deck (all parameters are described inside) and type :

./esvm

3) Plot the simulation results :

Type :

make extract

If you want to plot the distribution function in logarithmic scale, type :

make extract_logfe  

All simulation results are stored in text files located in the folder 'results' and the python scripts used to make the plots are located in the folder 'sources'.
The plots will be located in the folder 'figures'.
