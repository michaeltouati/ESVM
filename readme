ESVM (ElectroStatic Vlasov-Maxwell) is a Vlasov-Maxwell Fortran 90 code 
parallelized using OpenMP allowing for using many different numerical advection schemes 
as well as two numerical methods for solving the coupled Maxwell equations 
in order to adapt the simulation to specific Plasma Physics problems.

In order to :

1) Compile the code :

Modify the makefile as a function of the wished compilation options and the compilers installed on your computer and then type :

make

2) Run a simulation :

Fill the wished input-deck (all parameters are described inside) and type :

./esvm

3) Plot the simulation results :

Type :

make extract

If you want to plot the distribution function in logarithmic scale, type :

make extract_logfe  

All simulation results are stored in text files located in the folder 'results' and the python scripts used to make the plots are located in the folder 'sources'.
The plots will be located in the folder 'figures'.
